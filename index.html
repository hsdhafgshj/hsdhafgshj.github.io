<h1>Hello, I'm Michael</h1>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    Let me tell you a little bit about myself! My name is Michael and I go to <a href = "https://www.riverdaleschools.org" target = _blank> Riverdale High School</a> as a senior. I am eighteen years old, I live with my parents, and I work at Hungry Hobo.

<p>I like to do a lot of different things in my free time, the one I like the most is Fortnite or Minecraft. Sometimes I go outside. I also enjoy doing my Computer Science assingments in my free time as well. Computer Science (taught by Mr. Bob Manasco) is the bestest and dopest class in the whole school. I freaking love Computer Science!! :3</p>
<h2>About my friends</h2>
<p>
    My best friend is Andy Peter Murray and here is his <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/23409+80th+Ave+N,+Port+Byron,+IL+61275/@41.59849,-90.2974059,410m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x87e215557182baad:0xa48283c9502d824b!8m2!3d41.5987696!4d-90.2987317!16s%2Fg%2F11c5pgcs2t?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target = "_blank"> house.</a> Andy and I have a lot of fun together and we are <i><b><u>FREAKING</u></b></i> best friends, so nobody try to be his friend because he is <span style = "color:red"> taken</span>. We met when we were very young and mentally malleable, it was enemies to friends story, also our moms friends. Here are my favorite things about him:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>He is <span style = "color:#9aae07">SUPER SMART</span></li>
    <li>He is my friend.</li>
    <li>He is friends with Braeden Bode, which is good</li>
    <li>We play Minecraft</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Even though Andy is my bestest friend I also have other friends. My other friends are also cool, but not like Andy. Sometimes we play Fortnite and I like that about my other friends (who aren't Andy).

<h2>Closing Statements</h2>
<p>It has been nice to get to know you, I hope you like me. We are going to be friends forever, <span style = "color:red"><b>but not as good of friends as Andy.</b></span> I hope you enjoyed meeting the important figures in my life like Andy and <span style = "color:#6DB8FA"><b>Fortnite.</b></span></p>
